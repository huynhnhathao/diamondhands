## Is there a particular way of learning that is better than any other ways in the sense that it help you retain the knowledge and speed up the learning process?
Yes there is. If you just start learning without some specific techniques to help you increase the ability to focus on what you want to learn, or you don't do the right thing to help retain the things you have learnt after you have learnt it, it won't stay in your head. 
## List of the worth-remember stuffs related to learning efficiently
Most of these I learn from Huberman podcast
1. a deep sleep at the end of the day is the time for neural plasticity, aka let the things you learnt sink in your head
2. A nap without focus after a period of focus also help you sink in what you have learnt.
3. You have to be alert and focus when you learn, that is necessary for neural plasticity aka learning to happen. Alert is necessary for learning but without focus no learning happen.
4. You can not keep focusing all the waking hours, it is not efficient, by taking break and stop focusing on the thing you are learning will actually accelerate neural plasticity hence increase learning
